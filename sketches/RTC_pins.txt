 The backup battery makes sure that the time and date are kept accurate even if your Arduino is powered off.

- DS1302 timing IC
- This real time clock has the ability of calculating prior to the 2100 second, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, and the ability to adjust a leap year
- Wide working voltage: 2.0~5.5 V
- When The working voltage is 2.0V, the current is less than 300nA
- Read/write clock or RAM data have two transmission modes: Single-byte / many bytes group
- Simple 3 line interface. Easy to install
